          <strong>I have often thought about what makes a great website.</strong>  Well, to be honest, that's completely a lie.  I rarely think about what makes good websites.  I'm not a particularly good designer.  I spent some time reading design books this summer!  It was pretty fun, I suppose.  Let's see, what other books did I read this summer?  Well, I also read a book on D3 to prepare for this class.  It was <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/index.html">"Interactive Data Visualization for the Web"</a> by <a href="http://alignedleft.com/">Scott Murray</a>.  I didn't finish it; he seems to have not really finished the last chapter or so.  The stuff I read was good, though!

          You know, this is quickly turning into a demonstration of how <em>not</em> to write blog posts.  Maybe I shouldn't become a blogger, perhaps I ramble too much.  I'm mostly kidding, by the way.  I think I'd be a <em>great</em> blogger. I could blog about all kinds of things, like teaching, computer science, machine learning, raising a crazy child... There's no shortage of topics!  I could even create cool D3 data visualizations now that I've mostly finished reading that sweet book.
        </p>

           Anyway, here is some code I wrote:
        </p>
<pre><code>public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args){
    System.out.println("Hello, " + args[1]);
  }
}</code></pre>
       <p>
         I think it's quite nice.  I especially like the use of <tt>public</tt>, because I believe in making everything as open as possible.  I'm cool like that.
